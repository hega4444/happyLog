Hello there!

After a few months of very intensive coding, a topic that became more and more
important was to implement an efficient logging system.

When the code starts to pile in our folders, and the logic grows complexity, 
having some logging system at hand can make our coding much happier.

So I thought of showing how I evolved my logging from the beggining. 

You will find on this repo 4 different ways of logging, from the simplest to the one im currently using.

Hope you find this usefeul (L)

Happy logging!
